THE family of EQUATIONS OF KLEIN BOTTLE represented by(X,Y,Z) as an equation in 3D coordinate space .
The general equation is represented by

x=-(4 - 2 * cos(u)) * cos(v) + 6 * (sin(u) + 1) * cos(u),

y=16 * sin(u) and 

z=(4 - 2 * cos(u)) * sin(v)

0<=u<=2*pi

0<=v<=2*pi,  where pi=3.14 here 

our interface takes input in the form of above-mentioned whole equation family 
plots the interactive 3D , visually gradient and beautiful viewable graph and surface.
